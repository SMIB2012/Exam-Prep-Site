# Login Enhancement - Allow Username or Email

## ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Created CustomAuthenticationForm** (`core/forms/user_forms.py`):
- Extends Django's `AuthenticationForm`
- Accepts both username and email in the same field
- Automatically detects if input contains '@' (email format)
- Looks up username by email if email is provided
- Authenticates using username (original or converted from email)

#### **2. Updated CustomLoginView** (`core/views/auth_views.py`):
- Added `form_class = CustomAuthenticationForm`
- Updated error message to "Invalid email/username or password"
- No other changes to view logic

#### **3. Updated Login Template** (`templates/core/auth/login.html`):
- Changed label from "Email Address" to "Email or Username"
- Updated placeholder text to "Enter your email address or username"
- No additional fields added
- Page layout completely unchanged

### **How It Works:**

1. **User types in the field**: Can be either username OR email
2. **Form processing**: 
   - If input contains '@', treats it as email
   - Looks up the username associated with that email
   - Uses the username for authentication
3. **Authentication**: Django's standard authentication with username
4. **Result**: User can login with either credential type

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ Same single input field (no additional fields)
- ✅ Same page layout and design
- ✅ Clear labeling: "Email or Username"  
- ✅ Helpful placeholder text
- ✅ Works with both credential types seamlessly

### **Technical Implementation:**
```python
# In CustomAuthenticationForm.clean():
if '@' in username:
    try:
        user = User.objects.get(email=username)
        username = user.username  # Convert email to username
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        pass  # Let authentication fail normally

# Authenticate with username (original or converted)
self.user_cache = authenticate(self.request, username=username, password=password)
```

### **Testing:**
- ✅ Login with username works
- ✅ Login with email works  
- ✅ Invalid credentials properly rejected
- ✅ Form validation works for both types
- ✅ No changes to page appearance

The login functionality now accepts both username and email in the same field without any visual changes to the login page.
