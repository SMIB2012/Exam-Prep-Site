# Premium User Display Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem
Premium users were showing as "Free" in the user list at `/staff/users/` even when they were marked as premium in the database.

## Root Cause
The `UserProfile.is_premium_active` property requires both:
1. `is_premium = True` 
2. `premium_expires_at` to be set and in the future

However, when creating premium users, only `is_premium` was being set to `True`, but `premium_expires_at` was left as `None`, causing `is_premium_active` to return `False`.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Fixed Existing Premium Users
- Created `fix_premium_users.py` script
- Found 1 premium user without expiration date
- Set default expiration date (1 year from now)
- Result: Premium user now shows as "Premium" in the list

### 2. Fixed User Creation Process
**Single User Creation (`UserCreateView`):**
- Added logic to set `premium_expires_at` when `is_premium=True`
- Uses custom date if provided, otherwise defaults to 1 year from creation

**Bulk User Upload:**
- Applied same fix to bulk upload process
- Premium users from CSV now get proper expiration dates

### 3. Enhanced User Creation Form
**Added new field:**
- `premium_expires_at` - DateTime field for custom premium expiration
- Field shows/hides based on premium checkbox state
- Includes helpful tooltip text

### 4. Updated Template
- Added premium expiration field to `user_add.html`
- Added JavaScript to toggle field visibility
- Improved user experience for setting premium dates

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `staff/views/user_views.py` - Fixed premium logic in both single and bulk creation
2. `staff/forms.py` - Added `premium_expires_at` field to UserCreateForm
3. `templates/staff/users/user_add.html` - Added premium expiration field and JavaScript
4. `fix_premium_users.py` - Script to fix existing premium users

### Key Logic:
```python
# If user is marked as premium, set expiration date
if profile_data.get('is_premium', False):
    custom_expiry = form.cleaned_data.get('premium_expires_at')
    if custom_expiry:
        profile.premium_expires_at = custom_expiry
    else:
        # Default: 1 year from now
        profile.premium_expires_at = timezone.now() + timedelta(days=365)
```

## Test Results ✅
- ✅ Existing premium user now shows as "Premium"
- ✅ New premium users get proper expiration dates
- ✅ Template displays premium status correctly
- ✅ Form validation works with new field
- ✅ JavaScript toggle functionality works

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Admin Form:** Premium expiration field only shows when premium is checked
2. **Default Behavior:** If no custom date is set, defaults to 1 year
3. **Visual Feedback:** Clear labels and help text for admin users
4. **Data Integrity:** All premium users now have valid expiration dates

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The user list now accurately displays subscription status:
- Premium users with active subscriptions show "Premium" badge with crown icon
- Free users show "Free" badge
- Expired premium users will show as "Free" (as intended)

The fix ensures data consistency and proper premium user management going forward.
